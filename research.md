## Stars, Clouds, and Feedback 

My research revolves around three things: the cold gaseous environments in which stars are born, the stars, and the energy released from them as they evolve. This energy, known as stellar feedback, in turn shapes the physical properties of the stars' birthplace. Feedback plays a fundamental role in regulating the entire star formation process.

In fact, star formation is a multi-scale problem. Things going on from the galactic scales down to the scales of planetary discs are all interconnected to each other. I'm mostly concerned about the intermediate - the parsec scales, that is, the Giant Molecular Clouds (GMCs). Clouds typically lie along the spiral arms of galaxies. Within them, the turbulent gas collapses under its own gravity to become dense sheets and filaments. Once the density reaches a certain threshold, and provided that the gas is sufficiently cold, stars and stellar clusters begin to form. At this stage, the stellar masses follow a lognormal distribution, but with a power-law tail. This tail in the distribution indicates the rare presence of Massive Stars (> 10 $M_\odot$). Massive stars are important for their energy and momentum contribution to our Universe.

Blah.
