## Stars, Clouds, and Feedback 

My research revolves around three things: the cold gaseous environments in which stars are born, the stars, and the energy released from them as they evolve. This energy, known as stellar feedback, in turn shapes the physical properties of the stars' birthplace. Feedback plays a crucial role in regulating the entire star formation process.

In fact, star formation is a multi-scale problem. Things going on from the galactic scales down to the scales of planetary discs are all interconnected. I'm mostly concerned about the intermediate - the Giant Molecular Clouds (GMCs). Clouds typically lie along the spiral arms of galaxies. Turbulent gas in the clouds collapses under self-gravity to become dense sheets and filaments. Provided that the gas is sufficiently cold, stars and stellar clusters may begin to form. 

At this stage, the stellar masses generally obey a lognormal distribution, but with a distinct power-law tail. This tail indicates the rare presence of Massive Stars (over 10 times heavier than our Sun). Yet, the feedback from massive stars dominates the energy budget in our Galaxy. Ionizing radiation, stellar winds and Type II supernovae are all examples of it. Without feedback, stars could form extremely quickly and die out in a much shorter time than is observed. 

But how much of those feedback energy *actually* went into supporting the star-forming regions? How do we get the massive stars? Does feedback help or hinder their formation? These are the kind of questions to be solved. 

I work on different topics simultaneously ~~or I'll soon become bored~~. Scroll down to see more!
