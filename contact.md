##### Clarifications regarding my name:

My name in full is Cheryl Si Ching Lau, known as Cheryl Lau. Name in Chinese is written as 劉思晴. 

* "Lau" is the surname. 
* "Si Ching" are two Chinese characters that join together as a name. No, it's not "Si Lau".      
* It is conventional in Hong Kong to keep the two words separate, so not "Si-Ching" or "Siching".     
* Both "Cheryl" and "Si Ching" are first names. The latter is not a middle name.     
* Both English and Chinese names were given at birth. I did not name myself, in case you wonder.
