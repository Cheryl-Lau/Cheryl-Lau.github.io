#### Clarifications regarding my name

My name in full is Cheryl Si Ching Lau, known as Cheryl Lau. Name in Chinese is written as 劉思晴. 

Note: "Si Ching" are two Chinese characters that join together as a name. No, it's not "Si Lau".      
Note 2: It is conventional in Hong Kong to keep the two words separate, so not "Si-Ching" or "Siching".     
Note 3: Both "Cheryl" and "Si Ching" are first names. The latter is not a middle name.     
Note 4: Both English and Chinese names were given at birth. I did not name myself, in case you wonder.
