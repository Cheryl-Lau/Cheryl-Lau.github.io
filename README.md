Hi! I am a theoretical/computational astrophysicist and I recently completed my PhD studies at the University of St Andrews with Prof. Ian Bonnell, specialising in modelling stellar feedback in molecular clouds. I work with SPH and N-body simulations, and my goal is to be able to do this for a living. 
Previously I obtained my MSc by Research degree at the University of York under the supervision of Dr. Emily Brunsden, where I worked on asteroseismology. 
I also completed my BSc degree at the University of York, because I loved ~~their mallards~~ their physics department. 

I am a Hongkonger but I spent more time (legally) living in the UK since 2015. I'm fluent in Cantonese and British-English. Obsession with cats is what I am usually known for. Drawing is my passion and I'm a big fan of Japanese anime. As an indoor-cat-person, sports are not my thing; the photo above shows a rare sighting of me standing in sunlight.
